Welcome to the Trailway documentation.

The website is running at https://web2-trailway.herokuapp.com/

This application is quite easy to use, to be honest

 -- Type in your desired city of departure and arrival and the wesite will start calculating.
     -- Disclaimer: becauls of the way iRail works, some cities will have to be
        entered correctly, or they will simply not work and the site will crash.
        Example: 'bruxelles-midi' or 'brussel-zuid' will return
        an error, whereas 'bruxelles' or 'Brussel' will work as intended.
        There is nothing I could do to prevent this from happening. 
 -- Log in at Trailway to save the cities and routes you like.
     -- Like cities or specific routes by checking the box next to them.
        -- Disclaimer: checkboxes aren't styled due to time running short
        -- Disclaimer: you must be logged in to save routes or cities.
        If you are not logged in but check a box, you will be redirected
        to the login screen, from where you have the option to log in or
        sign up.

 -- Click on a city to load its map (https://www.mapbox.com/).

     -- Disclaimer: checkboxes aren't styled due to design reasons.
